# Sync your repo before coding

## SUPER IMPORTANT! Do this regularly to avoid conflicts with other team member's code changes.

1. Go to your repo on Github.com. For example, if your username is haxwell, your url would be http://www.github.com/haxwell/REPO-NAME-HERE.
2. Look for the link to Sync your Fork. Click it

Your repo in the cloud should now be in sync with the main Savvato-software branch.

On your local machine, go to the directory for this repo, then
1. git checkout main
2. git pull

If you have a feature you are working on,
1. git checkout your-feature-branch
2. git merge main
