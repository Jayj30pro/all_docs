# Johnathan's Presentation on Git

> Git uses a linked list.
>
> List of nodes are a branch.
>
> Start with the main branch.
>
> Set of changes is a delta.
>
> Delta is that node in that linked list
>
> The set of deltas brings you to your current state in your repository and it is a sequence of applied changes
>
> Branches - first change, second change, most recent change
>
> Git log is each a node that shows a change
>
> Can go back to a previous change and your repository is in that state in history
>
> When you create another branch, create another linked list
>
> When syncing fork, your syncing your fork to the remote branch
